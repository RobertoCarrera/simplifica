# Fix Applied: Tickets Component Now Loading Real Data

## Problem Identified
The `supabase-tickets.component.ts` was still using the old `SupabaseTicketsService` which returned hardcoded mock data instead of loading tickets from the actual Supabase database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `loadTickets()` method
- **Before**: Used `this.ticketsService.getTickets(companyIdNumber)` with numeric company ID conversion
- **After**: Uses `this.simpleSupabase.getClient().from('tickets')` with UUID company_id directly
- **Result**: Now loads real tickets from database with proper relationships (client, stage, company)

### 2. Updated `loadStages()` method
- **Before**: Used old service with numeric conversion
- **After**: Direct database query to `ticket_stages` table
- **Result**: Loads actual stage definitions from database

### 3. Updated `loadStats()` method
- **Before**: Used mock statistics from old service
- **After**: Calculates real statistics from loaded tickets data
- **Result**: Shows accurate counts of open, in-progress, completed, and overdue tickets

### 4. Fixed initialization order
- **Before**: All methods called in parallel, causing stats to calculate before tickets loaded
- **After**: Sequential loading: stages → tickets → stats, then others in parallel
- **Result**: Statistics are calculated from actual ticket data

## What Should Happen Now

1. **Run the cleanup script**: Execute `sql/cleanup_and_setup_final.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Check the frontend**: Navigate to `/tickets` and select a company
3. **Verify data**: You should now see real tickets from the database instead of hardcoded mock data

## Verification Steps

1. Open http://localhost:4200/tickets
2. Select a company from the dropdown
3. You should see:
   - Real tickets from the database (if any)
   - Accurate statistics in the dashboard
   - Proper stage filtering
   - Real client information

If you see "No hay tickets" it means:
- The cleanup script hasn't been run yet, OR
- No tickets exist for the selected company in the database

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL cleanup script to populate demo data
2. Refresh the page and verify tickets appear
3. Test creating new tickets to ensure they persist to the database
