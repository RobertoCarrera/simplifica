# Drag-and-Drop Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. **@angular/cdk Installation**
- Installed `@angular/cdk@19` with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Package added successfully to the project

### 2. **Stages Management Component** ✅ COMPLETE
- Added DragDropModule import
- Added drag-and-drop directives to template:
  - `cdkDropList` on grid containers
  - `cdkDrag` on each stage card
  - `cdkDragHandle` on drag handle div
- Implemented methods:
  - `onDropGeneric(event)` - handles reordering of generic stages
  - `onDropCompany(event)` - handles reordering of company stages
  - `updateStagePositions(stages)` - updates positions in database
- Added CSS styles for drag-and-drop visual feedback

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Drag Handle
- Appears on hover over any stage card
- Shows grip icon (📏) for intuitive dragging
- Uses absolute positioning in top-left corner
- Smooth opacity transition on hover

### Drag Preview
- Dragged item shows with reduced opacity (0.8)
- Enhanced shadow for visual depth
- Maintains original styling during drag

### Placeholder
- Shows where item will be dropped
- Reduced opacity (0.3) to indicate empty space
- Smooth animation during drag

### Animations
- Smooth 250ms cubic-bezier transition
- Items slide into new positions
- Cursor changes: grab → grabbing

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these scenarios:

### Stages Management
- [ ] Drag and drop generic stages to reorder
- [ ] Drag and drop company-specific stages to reorder
- [ ] Verify positions persist after page reload
- [ ] Test on mobile (should still work with touch)
- [ ] Verify hidden stages can still be dragged

### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Drag handle appears on hover
- [ ] Cursor changes during drag
- [ ] Preview shows correctly
- [ ] Placeholder indicates drop position
- [ ] Success toast appears after reordering

## 📝 Code Structure

### Pattern for Stages Component

```typescript
// Template
<div class="grid" cdkDropList (cdkDropListDropped)="onDrop($event)">
  @for (stage of stages; track stage.id) {
    <div class="card" cdkDrag>
      <div class="drag-handle" cdkDragHandle>
        <i class="fas fa-grip-vertical"></i>
      </div>
      <!-- Card content -->
    </div>
  }
</div>

// Component Methods
onDrop(event: CdkDragDrop<StageType[]>) {
  moveItemInArray(this.stages, event.previousIndex, event.currentIndex);
  this.updatePositions(this.stages);
}

private async updatePositions(stages: StageType[]) {
  for (let i = 0; i < stages.length; i++) {
    await this.service.update(stages[i].id, { position: i });
  }
  this.toast.success('Orden actualizado', '...');
}
```

## 📦 Files Modified

1. `src/app/components/stages-management/stages-management.component.ts` - Complete drag-and-drop for stages

## ℹ️ Notes

- The drag-and-drop works within each section independently (generic vs company)
- You cannot drag items between sections (by design)
- Hidden stages can still be reordered
- Position updates are saved immediately to the database
- If an error occurs during save, the original order is restored

## 🚫 Units Management

**Note:** Drag-and-drop functionality was **NOT** implemented for Units Management as it was not needed for system units.

**Status:** Implementation complete for Stages Management ✅
