-- Fix Critical RLS vulnerability in payment_integrations
-- Previously, policies allowed any admin (regardless of company) to see all integrations.
-- This migration enforces strictly that the user must be an admin/owner of the specific company.

-- Drop insecure policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "payment_integrations_update" ON public.payment_integrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "payment_integrations_delete" ON public.payment_integrations;
