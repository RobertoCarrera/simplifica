-- Migration: Fix Cross-Tenant Data Leak in payment_integrations
-- Date: 2026-02-24
-- Description: Restricts payment_integrations access to users belonging to the same company.

-- 1. Drop insecure policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "payment_integrations_select" ON public.payment_integrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "payment_integrations_insert" ON public.payment_integrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "payment_integrations_update" ON public.payment_integrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "payment_integrations_delete" ON public.payment_integrations;

-- 2. Create secure policies
-- SELECT: Users can only see integrations for their own company

      AND u.company_id = payment_integrations.company_id
      AND ar.name IN ('owner', 'admin', 'super_admin')
      AND u.deleted_at IS NULL
  )
);

-- INSERT: Users can only insert for their own company
CREATE POLICY "payment_integrations_insert" ON public.payment_integrations
